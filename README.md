# Activity finder

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create an activity finding application that suggests physical activities to users based on their preferences. The application will take user inputs and match them with suitable activities from a predefined list of physical activities that are scraped from the 
website. 

## Project setup
- [x] Collect a comprehensive list of physical activities that you want to suggest to users. This
should be done by scraping data from the mentioned website.

- [x] Store the activity data in json format. Create a json to store activity details such as
activity type, location, duration, difficulty level, and any other relevant information.

- [x] Design the layout and flow of the user interface, keeping in mind the inputs and criteria
you defined in the project scope. Determine the specific inputs you will collect from
users, such as activity type, location, duration, difficulty level, and any other relevant
factors.
